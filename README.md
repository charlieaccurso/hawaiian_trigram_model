# hawaiian_trigram_model
Trigram model on an original dataset of 28 sentences

As I ran the model I either included correct outputs into the training data, or corrected the outputs and included them in the training data.

Outputs are frequently correct and make sense for this model.

Example correct outputs include:
<s> he ʻīlio nui kēia </s> "This is a big dog."
<s> nui ka ua i ke kau kupulau </s> "It rains a lot in the springtime."
<s> makemake au i ke kau hoʻoilo </s> "I want wintertime." (may sound strange to native speakers)
<s> ʻo ka pōʻakahi kēia </s> "Today is Monday."
<s> hoʻomoana kākou i ka hola ʻeono </s> "We all camp at six o'clock."
<s> ʻo kēia ka mahina ʻo malaki </s> "This is the month, March."
<s> aia ka ʻaha mele ma ka hale </s> "The concert is at the house."
<s> e hoʻokaika kino i ka lā ʻapōpō </s> "Work out tomorrow."
<s> makemake ʻoe e hoʻokaika kino i ka lā pōpeku </s> "Do you want to work out the day of the football game?"

Strange outputs:
<s> ikiiki ʻo heʻeia i ke kau kupulau ma hilo </s> "It's humid in He'eia in the springtime in Hilo."
<s> ʻo ka pōʻakahi </s> "Monday" (fragment)
<s> aia ka hālāwai kauka ma ka hale i ke kau kupulau ma hilo </s> "The doctor's appointment is at the house in the springtime in Hilo." (grammatical? but unnatural and verbose)
